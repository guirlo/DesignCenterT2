<Info description="This example simulates the ignition control of a four-cylinder engine. It has been developed as a collaboration between Guy Rouleau from MathWorks and Isaac Hisahiro Ito at Toyota Motor North America R&amp;D. The model is intended for demonstration and educational purpose.&#xa;&#xa;The model implements the following feature:&#xa;- Simscape language for modeling a four-cylinder engine ignition process&#xa;- Symbolic Math Toolbox for designing the engine model equations&#xa;- Simscape Driveline for modeling of the vehicle drivetrain&#xa;- Export-function model for the controller, allowing the code generated from it to be integrated with an external environment and scheduler&#xa;- Stateflow for simulating the Engine Control Unit scheduler&#xa;- SimEvents for simulation of hardware timers&#xa;&#xa;See this blog post for more details: https://blogs.mathworks.com/simulink/2018/11/07/internal-combustion-engine-ignition-control-example-part-1" />
